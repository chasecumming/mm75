                        <h2 class="section-heading">Little Women</h2>
                        <p>"Little Women" is a classic novel written by Louisa May Alcott, published in 1868. It follows the lives of the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. The story flows as they navigate the challenges of growing up during the Civil War era in Concord, Massachusetts. The story explores themes of family, friendship, love, and the pursuit of personal and artistic ambitions. Each sister has her own distinct personality and dreams, and the novel traces their journeys from adolescence to adulthood. "Little Women" is celebrated for its warmth, humor, and timeless portrayal of sisterhood and female independence. I would recommend this book to anyone who has the time to really sit down and enjoy the full story. <br>  
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Where the Crawdads Sing</h2>
                        <p>"Where the Crawdads Sing" is a novel written by Delia Owens, published in 2018. The story is set in the marshes of coastal North Carolina and revolves around Kya Clark, who is known as the "Marsh Girl." Abandoned by her family at a young age, Kya grows up alone in the wild, learning to survive by observing nature. As she matures, Kya becomes entangled in a local murder investigation when the town's golden boy, Chase Andrews, is found dead. The narrative alternates between Kya's coming-of-age story and the investigation into Chase's death, exploring themes of isolation, prejudice, resilience, and most of all, the healing power of nature. "Where the Crawdads Sing" is a lyrical and atmospheric tale that captivates readers with its vivid descriptions of the natural world and its poignant portrayal of human connection and survival. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good, deep emotional story. But don't be fooled, this is not a book for romance lovers, but those who love a good plot-twist. <br>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Alchemist</h2>
                        <p>"The Alchemist" is a philosophical novel written by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho, published in 1988. It tells the story of Santiago, a shepherd boy from Spain, who embarks on a journey to fulfill his personal legend, or his true purpose in life. His quest takes him from his homeland to the Egyptian desert, where he encounters a series of mentors, challenges, and spiritual revelations. Along the way, he learns valuable lessons about the importance of following one's dreams, listening to one's heart and embracing the mysteries of life. "The Alchemist" is a tale of self-discovery, destiny, and the transformative power of pursuing one's dreams with courage and determination. I would recommend this read to anyone who loves to sit and ponder. It’s definitely not a "thoughtless” read. <br>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Normal People</h2>
                        <p>"Normal People" is a novel written by Irish author Sally Rooney, published in 2018. The story follows the complex relationship between Connell and Marianne, two teenagers from a small town in Ireland. Despite their different social backgrounds, Connell being popular and Marianne an outsider, they form a deep connection. They navigate the ups and downs of their relationship, including misunderstandings, breakups, and reconciliations, they grapple with issues of class, identity, and intimacy. Set against the backdrop of their university years in Dublin, "Normal People" explores themes of love, friendship, power dynamics, and the ways in which individuals shape each other's lives. The novel really displays the raw intricacies of human relationships and the challenges of communication and self-discovery. I would recommend this read for mostly a young adult audience, or anyone looking for a real tearjerker. <br><p></p>
